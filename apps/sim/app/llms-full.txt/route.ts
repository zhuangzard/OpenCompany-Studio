> Sim is the open-source platform to build AI agents and run your agentic workforce. Connect 1,000+ integrations and LLMs to deploy and orchestrate agentic workflows.

## Overview

Sim lets teams create agents, workflows, knowledge bases, tables, and docs. Over 100,000 builders use Sim — from startups to Fortune 500 companies. Teams connect their tools and data, build agents that execute real workflows across systems, and manage them with full observability. SOC2 and HIPAA compliant.

## Product Details

- **Product Name**: Sim
- **Category**: AI Agent Platform / Agentic Workflow Orchestration
- **Deployment**: Cloud (SaaS) and Self-hosted options
- **Pricing**: Free tier, Pro ($20/month), Team ($40/month), Enterprise (custom)
- **Compliance**: SOC2 Type II, HIPAA compliant

## Core Concepts

### Workspace
A workspace is the top-level container in Sim. It holds workflows, data sources, credentials, and execution history. Users can create multiple workspaces for different projects or teams.

### Workflow
A workflow is a directed graph of blocks that defines an agentic process. Workflows can be triggered manually, on a schedule, or via webhooks. Each workflow has a unique ID and can be versioned.

### Block
A block is an individual step in a workflow. Types include:
- **Agent Block**: Executes an LLM call with system prompts and tools
- **Function Block**: Runs custom JavaScript/TypeScript code
- **API Block**: Makes HTTP requests to external services
- **Condition Block**: Branches workflow based on conditions
- **Loop Block**: Iterates over arrays or until conditions are met
- **Router Block**: Routes to different paths based on LLM classification

### Trigger
A trigger initiates workflow execution. Types include:
- **Manual**: User clicks "Run" button
- **Schedule**: Cron-based scheduling (e.g., every hour, daily at 9am)
- **Webhook**: HTTP endpoint that triggers on incoming requests
- **Event**: Triggered by external events (email received, Slack message, etc.)

### Execution
An execution is a single run of a workflow. It includes:
- Input parameters
- Block-by-block execution logs
- Output data
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Duration and performance metrics
